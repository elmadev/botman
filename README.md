## Development starting guide:
- Install Meteor
  - Windows: https://install.meteor.com/windows
  - Linux: `curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`
- Fork the repo and git clone
- Create own server in Discord for testing purposes
- Rename `settings-example.json` to `settings-development.json` and add own bot token, api keys etc
- `npm install` in the project's folder
- Run locally with `npm start`

(Someone add more details here about the process like commands and also Windows-specific problem solutions?)

## Contribution guidelines
Let's try to keep it [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/) compliant. Project structure roughly follows [Mantra](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra) suggestions.

Separation of concerns:
- Put various settings, simple response lists and helper functions in separate files whenever possible and import them where needed, to improve readability in the main bot file (`bot.js`)
- Let `Meteor.methods` deal with all database operations
